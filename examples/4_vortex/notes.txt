why is the phase output desired vs calculated so different:


The reason the two images look so different is due to a phenomenon called phase wrapping.

The optimizer has correctly learned how to create the vortex, but it has done so by creating a lens that is much thicker than it needs to be. The result is physically correct, but the visualization makes it look different.

The Desired Phase vs. The Calculated Phase

Desired Phase (Your First Image): This is the "perfect" or "ideal" phase profile for a vortex. It's a smooth, continuous ramp from -Ï€ to +Ï€. This is the simplest mathematical representation of the phase twist you want.

Calculated Phase (Your Second Image): This is the phase profile of a focusing lens, also known as a Fresnel zone plate. The concentric rings are the signature of a lens that bends light.

Why This is the Correct Answer

The simulation's goal is to match the output beam, not necessarily the phase profile in the most direct way possible. It has correctly figured out that to turn a wide input beam into a slightly smaller output vortex, it needs to both twist the phase and focus the beam.

The concentric rings you see are the focusing part of the solution. The underlying vortex twist is still there, but it's now combined with this powerful focusing effect.

The "Phase Wrapping" Analogy ðŸ•’

Imagine you want to tell someone to turn a knob by 90 degrees. You could just say "turn it 90 degrees."

But you could also say "turn it 450 degrees" (360 + 90). The final position of the knob would be exactly the same.

This is what's happening with the phase.

The desired phase is like saying "turn it 90 degrees."

The calculated phase is like saying "turn it 450 degrees." The optimizer has found a solution that adds extra multiples of 360 degrees (or 2Ï€ in radians) to the phase.

When you visualize the phase, the program can only show values between -180 and +180 degrees (-Ï€ to +Ï€). So, when the phase goes past 180, it "wraps around" back to -180, creating the sharp edges you see in the rings.
